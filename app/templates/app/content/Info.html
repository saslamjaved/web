Hi All, My name is Aslam Syed, I have been wprking with TCS for 14 years as a roles ranges from HPC Administrator, Ingrator, HPC cloud Architect in HPC environment
Durin my experience , i have understad Ins an Outs of the Industry.

I have had opportunity to work on various HPC project and domains, I have involed in projects to design and architect numerous HPC solutions for research communities such as Life Sciences, Engineering, Animation etc.

    Overcoming HPC Challenges to Optimize Workloads Properly deploying and tuning an HPC cluster is specialized work that can take significant time and resources. <br><br>

    HPS clusters generally aim for the maximum capability computing rather than capacity computing

    As HPC deployment and usage continue escalating, systems and interdependencies are also growing.

    more significant challenges organizations face when deploying HPC platforms.<br><br>


    HPC Architecture - An effective HPC architecture goes far beyond the hardware and cloud platforms it uses. 
    <br>For example, HPC systems generate and process an enormous amount of data. <br>Data must be managed and stored efficiently using sophisticated networking and storage infrastructure for fast retrieval and data analysis. <br><br>

    Cluster Management, Control, and Security - 
    HPC clusters require both an underlying infrastructure to execute applications and a control layer to manage the infrastructure. <br><br>

    Legacy Resources - Legacy data centers may not support the hefty demands of HPC computing
    For example the newest generation of processors requires significantly higher levels of energy and generates more heat
    Without retrofitting cooling equipment, data centers may be unable to regulate temperatures appropriately. This problem only compounds as rack density increases. <br><br>


As new hardware is deployed, it must also be optimized to work efficiently together to maximize investment. Incompatible components or legacy equipment can easily become bottlenecks that throttle optimal output.
